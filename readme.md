ProjectInit: A Rapid Project Structure Generator
```
ProjectInit is a command-line tool designed to streamline the process of creating new projects by automatically generating basic project structures based on predefined templates.

It's a handy tool for developers who want to quickly get started on a new project without having to manually set up the initial files and directories.
```

## **Installation**
To install ProjectInit, use pip:

```bash
pip install projectinit
```

## **Usage**
```bash
projectinit --template <template_name> --output <output_directory>
```

`--template`: Specifies the desired template to use.

`--output`: Sets the output directory for the generated project.

### Available Templates
Currently, ProjectInit offers the following templates:

1. **web-app: A basic web application template with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

2. **python-project: A Python project template with a main.py file and a virtual environment setup guide.**

3. **node-app: A Node.js application template with an index.js file and package.json.**

#### (Consider adding more templates as your project evolves)

Examples
Create a new Python project:
```bash
projectinit --template python-project --output my_python_project
```

Generate a web application structure:
```bash
projectinit --template web-app --output my_web_app
```
